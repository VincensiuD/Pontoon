# Pontoon
A variation of BlackJack game where the players have more chance to win


Rules:

Player begins by putting a wager to bet for Pairs or Main. Then player will receive 2 cards and the dealer will receive one card.

Pairs game
If player receives 2 card with the same rank (e.g a pair of 2s, a pair of Js etc), then the player wins the Pairs game.
Payout for Pairs as follow:
1. Perfect Pairs (same rank, same suit) = 6 x Wagers
2. Colour Pairs (same rank, same colour but different suit) = 13 x Wagers
3. Mixed Pairs (same rank, differet colour) = 25 x Wagers


Main game
Each card has the value represented by the nominal of the cards (e.g. 2Spade has a value of 2, 10Diamond has the value of 10 etc)
Jack, Queen & King cards have the value of 10 and are called Picture cards
Ace cards have the value of 11 or 1 whichever is more advantageous to the player.


After receiving the initial 2 cards, the total value of those 2 cards are counted.
If player's total value is 21 (usually obtained by an Ace and either a Picture or 10 card), player wins automatically and no more card is dealt. This winning is called Pontoon.
If player's total value is less than 21, player could either:
stand - where player is satisfied with the total value of the cards and no more cards will be dealt to player
hit - player elect to add another card
double - player double their wager
split - player could split their hands into 2 separate game. Splitting is allowed if the value of the player's 2 inital cards are the same (e.g. pairs of 5s or a Jack & a 10)

If player choose to hit, the player will receive additional card and if the total value of the cards surpassed 21, the player is busted and automatically lose the game.
Players can continuously hit until they reach 21 - where they win and get paid immediately, or until they got busted, or if they have 5 cards in that hand, they automatically win and receives the payout.

If the player choose to stand, no more cards will be dealt to players and cards will be dealt to the dealer.
The dealer have to hit until the cards value is bigger than 16 and stand when their cards value is higher than 16.
If the dealer's card value is higher than 21, the dealer busts and player wins
If the dealer's card value is higher than the player's total card, the dealer wins and vice versa

The player can only double once per hand.

1. Pontoon - 2.5 x Main wager
